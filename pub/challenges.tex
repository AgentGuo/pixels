\section{Challenges}
We address the challenges of wide table analysis.
\subsection{Workload Modeling}

\subsection{Column Chunk Ordering}
Effective column chunk ordering strategies shall satisfy following constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Colocate frequently paired visited column chunks as close as possible physically.
	\item Tradeoff between ordering and reconstruction.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Data Splitting}

\subsection{Column Chunk Caching}
Nowadays commonly used cache mechanism on HDFS is based on its block, caching on more precise units such as column chunks can help improve query performance.
