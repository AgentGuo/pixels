\section{Preliminaries}

In this section, we review today's HDFS-based column stores in which wide tables are stored, and how queries are executed on top of these wide tables \cite{IEEEexample:IEEEwebsite}.

\subsection{Table Layout in HDFS Column Store}
\todo{1) columnar format in HDFS; 2) wide tables are store in these formats; 3) disk seek cost problem.}


\subsection{Query Execution on Wide Tables}

\todo{1) one task per split / row group; 2) task schedule and initialization cost; 3) adaptive split size problem.}
